            <p>
              Aux Wars is a free party game with no accounts and no logins. We don&apos;t ask for
              your name beyond a temporary display name you type for a game, and we don&apos;t sell
              your personal information.

            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
              <li>A temporary display name and an anonymous game/session identifier, used only to run the game in real time.</li>
              <li>Your song picks and ratings within a game.</li>
              <li>Anonymous, aggregate usage analytics (e.g. how many games are played and which features are used).</li>

            <p>
              If advertising is enabled, we use Google AdSense to show ads, which may set cookies
              to measure and personalize advertising. We ask for your consent before serving these
              ads, and you can decline. Ads are never shown to players in a room hosted with the

            <p>
              We use YouTube, the iTunes Search API, and Deezer API to find songs and play
              clips/previews, Convex to run real-time game state, PostHog for product analytics,
              and Google AdSense for advertising (when enabled). Each handles data under its
              own policies.
